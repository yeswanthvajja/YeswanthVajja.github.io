## Introduction

In computer science, **Stack** and **Queue** are two fundamental data structures that are used to store collections of data. They have different characteristics and are used in different scenarios. In this post, we will explore the differences between Stack and Queue in Java.

## What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. You can think of it like a stack of plates; you can only add or remove the top plate.

### Key Operations:
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.

### Example in Java:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        stack.push(3);
        
        System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek()); // Output: 3
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Output: 3
        System.out.println("Top element after pop: " + stack.peek()); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. You can think of it like a line of people waiting for service; the first person in line is the first to be served.

### Key Operations:
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the front element from the queue.
- **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.

### Example in Java:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(1);
        queue.add(2);
        queue.add(3);
        
        System.out.println("Front element: " + queue.peek()); // Output: 1
        System.out.println("Dequeued element: " + queue.poll()); // Output: 1
        System.out.println("Front element after dequeue: " + queue.peek()); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Key Differences between Stack and Queue

| Feature          | Stack                     | Queue                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Order            | LIFO (Last In First Out)  | FIFO (First In First Out) |
| Main Operations   | Push, Pop, Peek           | Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek    |
| Use Cases        | Function call management, Undo mechanisms | Task scheduling, Print job management |

## Conclusion

Both Stack and Queue are essential data structures in Java, each serving different purposes. Understanding their differences and use cases can help you choose the right one for your specific needs. Whether you are managing function calls with a stack or scheduling tasks with a queue, these data structures are fundamental to efficient programming.
