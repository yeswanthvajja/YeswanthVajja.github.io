## Introduction

In computer science, **Stack** and **Queue** are two fundamental data structures that are used to store and manage data. They have different characteristics and are used in various scenarios. In this post, we will explore the differences between Stack and Queue in Java.

## What is a Stack?

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. You can think of a stack as a collection of items stacked on top of each other, like a stack of plates.

### Key Operations of Stack:
- **Push**: Add an item to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the item from the top of the stack.
- **Peek**: Retrieve the top item without removing it.

### Example in Java:
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        stack.push(3);
        
        System.out.println("Top element: " + stack.peek()); // Output: 3
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop()); // Output: 3
        System.out.println("Top element after pop: " + stack.peek()); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## What is a Queue?

A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. You can think of a queue as a line of people waiting for service.

### Key Operations of Queue:
- **Enqueue**: Add an item to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the item from the front of the queue.
- **Front**: Retrieve the front item without removing it.

### Example in Java:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class QueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(1);
        queue.add(2);
        queue.add(3);
        
        System.out.println("Front element: " + queue.peek()); // Output: 1
        System.out.println("Dequeued element: " + queue.poll()); // Output: 1
        System.out.println("Front element after dequeue: " + queue.peek()); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Key Differences between Stack and Queue

| Feature          | Stack                       | Queue                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Order of Access   | Last In First Out (LIFO)   | First In First Out (FIFO)   |
| Main Operations   | Push, Pop, Peek            | Enqueue, Dequeue, Front     |
| Use Cases         | Function call management, Undo mechanisms | Task scheduling, Print job management |

## Conclusion

Both Stack and Queue are essential data structures in Java, each serving different purposes. Understanding their differences and use cases will help you choose the right one for your programming needs. Whether you are managing function calls with a stack or scheduling tasks with a queue, mastering these data structures is crucial for efficient programming.
